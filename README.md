# What the app is about?
It's an app that uses the HackerNews API to display the latest news in the world of tech and programming. After a few days of installing on my phone, I've found myself checking the app at least twice daily to check for trending stories on HackerNews.
Each HackerNews story has a `URL` which links to an article. These articles can be read within the app and does not require opening an external browser to read stories.
